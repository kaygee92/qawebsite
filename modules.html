    There are three modules that are made of seven weeks each. Each module is designed to help the trainees learn more technical skills. In Mod One, trainees are taught the foundation of technology and how to maneuver throughout the workplace. Trainees take trainings in Technology Foundations, Web Development, Professional Skills and Business Communications. Module Two is building upon the skills of the individual skills that the trainees may have developed. The trainings that the trainees have are System Administrations, IT Help desk, along with the Pro Skills and Business Communications.
